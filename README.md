## 1. Project Title
House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## 2. Problem Statement or Research Question
</br>
‚ùì Research Questions : 
1. Can more refined feature engineering and model tuning improve prediction accuracy and achieve a higher Kaggle ranking?
2. How can we build a machine learning model to accurately predict house prices?
3. What are the most influential factors affecting house prices?

üí° (I have previously worked on this competition in a group project, where the score was only about R¬≤ ‚âà 0.92, and the Kaggle Leaderboard performance was average. Some tasks such as EDA were completed by my teammates. This time, I want to complete it independently, optimize the process, and gain a deeper understanding of models like Random Forest and XGBoost, or possibly explore other better-performing models. By doing this, I can sharpen my skills within a limited timeframe, work more efficiently, and deliver a higher-quality side project.)

3. Description of the Project
üìù Project Description
 This project aims to use the Kaggle House Prices dataset to build regression models for predicting house sale prices.
Independently conduct and optimize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for deeper insights
Experiment with different regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, Lasso/Ridge Regression)
Perform feature engineering (e.g., create HouseAge, RemodAge, TotalSF)
Apply hyperparameter tuning to improve performance
The final results will be submitted to the Kaggle Leaderboard, with comparisons and evaluations of different models.
